## 🛠️ Usage Guide

### 1 — Upload images

Click **Browse files** or drag and drop images onto the upload area. Supported formats: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`, `.bmp`, `.tiff`.

### 2 — Configure the layout (sidebar)

#### Compression

Enabled by default at **Medium**. Three quality levels are available:

| Level | JPEG Quality | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| **Low** | 82 | Printing — maximum detail |
| **Medium** | 55 | Balanced size vs. quality |
| **High** | 22 | Sharing digitally — smallest file |

#### Metadata

**Strip metadata** is enabled by default. Removes all EXIF data (GPS coordinates, camera model, timestamps, lens info) from images before they are written to any export file. EXIF orientation is applied first so photos stay correctly rotated, then the metadata is cleared.

#### Images per Page

| Option | Grid | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | 1 × 1 | Full-page single photo |
| **2** | 2 × 1 | Side-by-side comparison |
| **4** | 2 × 2 | Contact sheet, passport photos (default) |
| **Other** | Auto | Any custom number up to 50 |

For custom values the grid columns are calculated as `ceil(√n)` and rows as `ceil(n / cols)`.

#### Export Format

Select one or more formats before hitting **Generate**:

- **PDF** — print-ready, consistent across systems (default)
- **HTML** — open in any browser and use `Ctrl + P` to print; fully self-contained with embedded images
- **DOCX** — editable Word document with a borderless table grid

### 3 — Generate & download

Click **Generate**. The app processes all images and shows a download button for each selected format. An inline HTML preview is also available if HTML export was selected.
